Math::Expression version 1.21
=============================

This module solves the problem of evaluating expressions read from config/...
files without the use of eval. String and arithmetic operators are supported,
as are: conditions, arrays and functions. The name-space is managed (for
security), user provided functions may be specified to set/get variable values.
Error messages may be via a user provided function.
This is not designed for high computation use.

Quick example:

	use strict;
	use Math::Expression;

	my $ArithEnv = new Math::Expression;

	# Some/all of these read from a config file:
	my $tree1 = $ArithEnv->Parse('ConfVar := 42');

	my $tree2 = $ArithEnv->Parse('ConfVar * 3');

	...

	$ArithEnv->Eval($tree1);
	my $ConfValue = $ArithEnv->EvalToScalar($tree2);


For examples of use see the test program in the t/ directory
and some more in Examples/.
POD documentation is in the module.

You install the module by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install



Please report any bugs/suggestions to Alain Williams <addw@phcomp.co.uk>


It is understood that any contribution that is sent in for distribution
with this module shall have copyright assigned to addw who will release
it under the same licence as the rest of the module. Contributions will
be acknowledged.



You may get a bit more debugging/information from the test scripts by
the use of environment options, so:

Trace:
	TRACE=1 perl -Iblib/lib t/test.t
The TRACE value can be 1 or 2.

Print out the parse tree on error:
	ERR_TREE=1 perl -Iblib/lib t/test.t
